//EXERCISE:
//IN A CONSOLE APP, CREATE CODE THAT DOES THE FOLLOWING:
//1. Create a list of integers.Ask the user for a number to divide each number in the list by.Write a loop that 
//    takes each integer in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.
//    2. Run that code, entering in non-zero numbers as the user.Look at the displayed results.
//    3. Run that code, entering in zero as the number to divide by.Note any error messages you get.
//    4. Run that code, entering in a string as the number to divide by.Note any error messages you get.
//    5. Now put the loop in a try/catch block.Below and outside of the try/catch block, make the program display 
//    a message to the display to let you know the program has emerged from the try/catch block and continued on with 
//    program execution.In the catch block, display the error message to the screen.Then try various combinations of user 
//    input: valid numbers, zero and a string. Ensure the proper error messages display on the screen, and that the code 
//    after the try/catch block gets executed.
