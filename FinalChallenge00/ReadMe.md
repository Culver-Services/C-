Final Challenge

As covered many times in your training, the abilities to self-teach and debug are vital to being a successful developer. There are too many possible coding situations and projects for us to be able to prepare you for. Therefore, our goal is to teach you how to teach yourself. With that goal in mind, you will now complete tasks that require online research and some self-educating. This challenge is meant to be completed in around an hour. 

The purpose of this challenge is not to give you further experience in writing C# or Razor, itâ€™s to teach you how to spin up an ASP.NET Core web application and publish it to Azure. 

Complete these tasks (note: you do not have to define terms you understand already):

Define the C# DateTime.Now property (i.e., Google the term, read articles, watch videos, etc.).
